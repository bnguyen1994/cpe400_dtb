Vehicles attempt to move row-wise until they're in the same column as their destination. Then they move column-wise. 

Note: Vehicles are not allowed to move through each other and are not allowed to turn around immediately

If a path is obstructed, the vehicle will attempt to go in an optimal direction perpendicualar to its current direction. (e.g. if a vechicle is going right and is obstructed it will go up or down)

If the path is further obstructed attempt to 'wiggle' our way out (try all differnt kinds of directions)

If no path seemingly exists, give up all hope (You're in prision now...)
